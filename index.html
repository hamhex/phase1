							<h2><span>January, 2005 (1B)</span></h2>
							<div><p>In the wake of the Indian ocean earthquake-tsunami, my teacher asked each student in my class to do a project on the disaster. Doing that project really had an effect on me because it was the first time that the concept of death entered my world view. It blew my mind that one life could end just like that, much less the lives of thousands of people. As I documented the events the events that led up to and followed the disaster, I was struck with a terrible feeling of sorrow for the families affected. It didn't help that Taiwan (where I lived at the time) was situated in a crazy seismically active zone. We would experience earthquakes all the time, and I felt very physically insecure for a while. I couldn't stop thinking about what I would do if something like that really did happen to me. The project also opened my eyes to a world that I was totally unfamiliar with - a world of pain and disaster and suffering, a world that is indifferent to whether you live or die. </p></div>

							<h2><span>Early 2005: The Death Talk (1C)</span></h2>
							<div><p>My dad used to sit beside my bed until I feel asleep. One night (probably a few weeks after I had completed the tsunami project - see 1B) I asked him, “What happens to people after they die?” It’s probably the oldest conversation I remember ever having. I’m not so sure about whether I still believe his answer, but that was what got me thinking about life after death and existence. I remember him not wanting to answer some of my questions. “What if you’re not old when you die? What if you still haven’t finished some things?” “Then you leave without finishing some things.” It’s had an effect on the way that I’ve viewed death - that there is an expiration date on your body, but not on your soul, or whatever you leave behind. And I was never scared of death from that night forward.<br><center><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUO_5EALZoM">(Don't Fear) The Reaper</a><br>Blue Oyster Cult - Agents of Fortune</center></p></div>

							<h2><span>Iraq and a hard place (1D)</span></h2>
							<div><p>My first language was Cantonese, and I went to an English-speaking preschool and kindergarten. For grade one, I started going to an international school in Taipei. Upon my first steps into the classroom, my Mandarin-speaking teacher asked me what my name was. I had no idea what she was saying, so I asked her in English what she said. She couldn’t understand me either! I didn’t realize it then, but that was probably the beginning of my struggles regarding my cultural identity.  Being a second generation immigrant has always put me in a difficult position because I have a choice. A choice to discard my family’s culture, to embrace it with open arms, or to somehow reconcile the two. </p> <p>
At the age of 7 I was fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. Today I’ve effectively lost the ability to speak Mandarin. There was a time when I wasn’t sorry about that. I quit my supplementary Mandarin class because I didn’t enjoy it, and found there to be an unsupportive learning environment. I only understood the implications of quitting the class later on, when I realized just how many doors had closed on me because of my decision. I also met peers who were, for all intents and purposes, completely disconnected from their heritage and culture. It dawned on me that I had not only a responsibility, but a choice, to retain my culture for future generations. I became more aware of how I deal with aspects of my culture. At home I try to speak as much Cantonese as possible (even if my grammar is sometimes atrocious), and when my family members go into their spiels about Chinese history, I make an effort to really grasp what they’re saying. It sucks sometimes, but so what? Someone’s gotta do it.</p><p><br>
My homework that night was to write my name out in Chinese 50 times. I still remember how to do that. <br><br><center><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQAyVdnUAWU">Tongues</a><br>Joywave - How Do You Feel Now?</center></p></div>

							<h2><span>Here, There, Everywhere (1E)</span></h2>
							<div><p>I was born in Canada, but within a year my family left and we settled in Taiwan, where my brother was born. Over the next seven years, we flew back and forth constantly. For holidays and celebrations we would fly to Hong Kong, where the entire maternal side of the family was situated, or Canada, where the entire paternal side was situated. In addition to becoming a frequent flier, I think those seven years really enhanced my adaptability to different environments and situations. They’ve also made me picky, but not really in the conventional way. I can sleep under any lighting conditions, in virtually any position. Name any kind of cuisine and I’ll eat it. But those years of flying back and forth made me have a sort of compulsion to be in an engaging environment. I spent the majority of my childhood in big city places like Toronto, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Vancouver, and in doing so, developed an appetite for visual and intellectual stimulation. Having such an expansive world view at a young age also made me think more globally and realize that one rarely does anything in isolation. I have not been an impulsive person ever since I figured out that all of my actions have repercussions elsewhere. </p></div>

							<h2><span>Hello World (1F)</span></h2>
							<div><p>People sometimes refer to me as shy. What I am is reserved. Ever since I joined Facebook, I’ve decided not to be an open book. When I first signed in I was taken aback by how completely public it was. If you so wished, you could put everything one could possibly want to know about you up online, where everyone could see. And while many of my peers didn’t seem to have a problem with that fact, I realized I did. 
When you share information, you lose control over it. When you start sharing every aspect of your life, it then becomes a bigger and bigger issue. It’s not about whether you have anything to hide. It’s about having a corner of your life that is well and truly yours. The feeling of having a monopoly over your life’s information is something that empowers me.
Our culture is so obsessed with exposing people’s lives. It’s become practically a science. As a society, we know the most minute, mundane details of celebrities’ lives - down to the toothpaste brand they use. Because of the media, there are people who have dropped all pretense of having a monopoly over their own information. I decided I didn’t want to be a part of that. I closed my book.</p></div>
