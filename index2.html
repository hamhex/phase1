							<h2><span>School Year, 2008-2009 (2A)</span></h2>
							<div>
                                I don’t know why I remember that this happened.</p><br><p>

                            In grade five, my teacher asked an open question to the class. Immediately he was flooded with answers, and the room quickly became filled with the jabber of twenty-five preteens. I, inexplicably supercharged by the previous recess, yelled out my own answer. Mine was the loudest voice in the room. Instantly the class became silent. <i>Jocelyn? Yelling??? Unhead of. Must be some kind of conspiracy.</i> Even the lecture that followed seemed to be subtly directed toward me. As the class settled back down to do seatwork, I kept thinking, “Oh man. I didn’t use my indoor voice. Why didn’t I use my indoor voice?” I didn’t even know that I had an outdoor voice!
Over the years, this indoor voice vs. outdoor voice thing transitioned to speaking up vs. not speaking at all. People think I am quiet, I feel like I’m expected to be quiet, and it just perpetuates the cycle. It’s definitely held me back in terms of losing opportunities to express myself. My cautiousness has contributed to this as well (see Exhibit 1E). Sometimes I’ll struggle to formulate a reply to someone during a conversation and by the time I’m completely satisfied with my answer, the conversation has already moved on. This willingness to speak up also plays into my social anxiety (see Exhibit 2C).

							<h2><span>Sensitivity (2B)</span></h2>
							<div>
								I am a sensitive person mostly because of the way I was brought up. The majority of my childhood was arguably geared toward learning how to please people. To put the square peg in the square hole so that all the adults would clap. To do well in school so that everyone would say “Well done!”. It fostered within me a need to know that I am performing to the standards of others. So I have always cared what people thought about me. I have done this to the point where I go over the top a little bit (see Exhibit 2C).

							<h2><span>Paranoid Android (2C)</span></h2>
							<div>
								My parents have always been highly critical people. It’s easy for them to pick out the worst in people. When we watch TV as a family, they don’t hesitate to point out the man they think is ugly, the girl they think is stupid, the lack of potential in an actor or contestant. Some of my peers do the same. One minute they’re talking to someone, and the next, they’re bad-mouthing about them behind their back to me. It’s not particularly malicious - just a negative offhand comment. But all they make me do is wonder, “They talked behind ____’s back. Could they be doing the same for me?” This paranoia, coupled with my emotional sensitivity (see Exhibit 2B) and unwillingness to speak up (see Exhibit 2A), has contributed to the development of my mild social anxiety. <br>
                                It’s gotten better, but it used to be that I’d get nervous just from anticipating my name being called during attendance. <i>When’s my name being called? What should I say - “Here” or “Present”? Neither? What tone of voice should I use? Will that be too loud? How’s my posture?</i> There were situations that I would micromanage to the point where it became downright taxing. Not reverting to that is sometimes still a challenge nowadays, because my self-confidence is not where it needs to be yet (see Exhibit 2D and 2G).

							<h2><span>Substitute (2D)</span></h2>
							<div>
                                I’ve always had problems with regards to self-confidence (see Exhibits 2A, 2B, 2C), but the concept that just destroys me is the thought of not being good enough. Being second best. I wrote a short piece a while ago, about an encounter between me and someone else, that attempts to sum up my frustrations: <a href="http://docdro.id/Y8Ru4TC"><u>http://docdro.id/Y8Ru4TC</u></a> (password: wileywiggins)<br><br><center><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW151uVRA7k">Substitute</a><br>The Who</center>

							<h2><span>Saint Cecilia, 1895</span></h2>
							<div>
                                On April 28th, 2015, I stood in front of 16 000 people in a massive convention centre in Orlando, Florida to claim a trophy. My partner and I had won 2nd place at DECA’s annual International Competition. It was an amazing moment, and all the work we had put into it just made it that much sweeter. What made and continues to make me happy was that I had done something few others had done before. With the hours of preparation and study, we managed to place highly in regionals, provincials, and internationals. Grade 11 was my first time in DECA. I had never even taken a business course (in fact, I still have zero interest in business). But I succeeded despite everything, and my self-confidence grew sizes and sizes that day. <i>Maybe. Just maybe,</i> I said to myself, <i>I’m not totally worthless</i>.
