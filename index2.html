							<h2><span>School Year, 2008-2009 (2A)</span></h2>
							<div>
                                I don’t know why I remember that this happened.</p><br><p>

                            In grade five, my teacher asked an open question to the class. Immediately he was flooded with answers, and the room quickly became filled with the jabber of twenty-five preteens. I, inexplicably supercharged by the previous recess, yelled out my own answer. Mine was the loudest voice in the room. Instantly the class became silent. <i>Jocelyn? Yelling??? Unhead of. Must be some kind of conspiracy.</i> Even the lecture that followed seemed to be subtly directed toward me. As the class settled back down to do seatwork, I kept thinking, “Oh man. I didn’t use my indoor voice. Why didn’t I use my indoor voice?” I didn’t even know that I had an outdoor voice!
Over the years, this indoor voice vs. outdoor voice thing transitioned to speaking up vs. not speaking at all. People think I am quiet, I feel like I’m expected to be quiet, and it just perpetuates the cycle. It’s definitely held me back in terms of losing opportunities to express myself. My cautiousness has contributed to this as well (see Exhibit 1E). Sometimes I’ll struggle to formulate a reply to someone during a conversation and by the time I’m completely satisfied with my answer, the conversation has already moved on. This willingness to speak up also plays into my social anxiety (see Exhibit 2C).

							<h2><span>Sensitivity (2B)</span></h2>
							<div>
								I am a sensitive person mostly because of the way I was brought up. The majority of my childhood was arguably geared toward learning how to please people. To put the square peg in the square hole so that all the adults would clap. To do well in school so that everyone would say “Well done!”. It fostered within me a need to know that I am performing to the standards of others. So I have always cared what people thought about me. I have done this to the point where I go over the top a little bit (see Exhibit 2C).

							<h2><span>Paranoid Android (2C)</span></h2>
							<div>
								My parents have always been highly critical people. It’s easy for them to pick out the worst in people. When we watch TV as a family, they don’t hesitate to point out the man they think is ugly, the girl they think is stupid, the lack of potential in an actor or contestant. Some of my peers do the same. One minute they’re talking to someone, and the next, they’re bad-mouthing about them behind their back to me. It’s not particularly malicious - just a negative offhand comment. But all they make me do is wonder, “They talked behind ____’s back. Could they be doing the same for me?” This paranoia, coupled with my emotional sensitivity (see Exhibit 2B) and unwillingness to speak up (see Exhibit 2A), has contributed to the development of my mild social anxiety. <br>
                                It’s gotten better, but it used to be that I’d get nervous just from anticipating my name being called during attendance. <i>When’s my name being called? What should I say - “Here” or “Present”? Neither? What tone of voice should I use? Will that be too loud? How’s my posture?</i> There were situations that I would micromanage to the point where it became downright taxing. Not reverting to that is sometimes still a challenge nowadays, because my self-confidence is not where it needs to be yet (see Exhibit 2D and 2G).<br><br><center><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTGr5t3MoY">Basket Case</a><br>Green Day</center>

							<h2><span>Substitute (2D)</span></h2>
							<div>
                                I’ve always had problems with regards to self-confidence (see Exhibits 2A, 2B, 2C), but the concept that just destroys me is the thought of not being good enough. Being second best. I wrote a short piece a while ago, about an encounter between me and someone else, that attempts to sum up my frustrations: <a href="http://docdro.id/Y8Ru4TC"><u>http://docdro.id/Y8Ru4TC</u></a> (password: wileywiggins)<br><br><center><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW151uVRA7k">Substitute</a><br>The Who</center>

							<h2><span>April 28th, 2015 (2D)</span></h2>
							<div>
                                On April 28th, 2015, I stood in front of 16 000 people in a massive convention centre in Orlando, Florida to claim a trophy. My partner and I had won 2nd place at DECA’s annual International Competition. It was an amazing moment, and all the work we had put into it just made it that much sweeter. What made and continues to make me happy was that I had done something few others had done before. With the hours of preparation and study, we managed to place highly in regionals, provincials, and internationals. Grade 11 was my first time in DECA. I had never even taken a business course (in fact, I still have zero interest in business). But I succeeded despite everything, and my self-confidence grew sizes and sizes that day. <i>Maybe. Just maybe,</i> I said to myself, <i>I’m not totally worthless</i>.

							<h2><span>June 24th, 2015 (2E)</span></h2>
							<div>
								On June 24th, 2015, I confessed to someone that I had liked for 4 years. While it did sting a little when I was rejected, the reason it changed me was because it underlined the fact that I was deeply unsatisfied with myself. For one reason or another (see Exhibits 2A-2D), I was not the person I wanted to be. And I decided that I couldn’t expect someone to like me if I didn’t even like myself. Regardless of whether or not it makes me less likable, I decided that I want people to see me as I am. Over the summer I tried to figure out what I wanted to change, and I hope to put my plans in motion this school year.

							<h2><span>The Sculpture (2F)</span></h2>
							<div>
								The main thing I realized over the summer, looking back at my life so far in terms of self-confidence, was that there is a disconnect between who I am and who I want to be. That most of what I put out there isn’t me. It’s a me that I regress to because I am hesitant of being myself around others. 
I read about Michelangelo, who once said that his sculptures were already in the blocks of granite from the very beginning; he just had to chisel off everything around them. I think that’s an accurate representation of my life right now. I am not fully formed yet. What I figured out this past summer was how I’m going to go about closing this gap between the block and the statue.

							<h2><span>Grade One, Fall (2G)</span></h2>
							<div>
								One day in grade one, I was sitting in class doing seatwork when my best friend grabbed my hand, whispered something inaudible to me, and took off. She pulled me out of the classroom with her, and together we ran through the corridors of our school, down stairwells I had never been to, past rows of 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10-year-olds. Before I could ask her where we were going, we had arrived at the door of the music room. Upon opening it we were greeted by the broad smiles of 6 grade eight girls, impossibly older than us. “Remember when I asked you if you liked singing?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>“Not really.”<br><br>
My friend had signed me up for choir. Every Friday after that, the 8 of us would rehearse after school until the sky turned pitch black. We participated in choral competitions. We sang in English, Chinese, even Hebrew. I didn’t think I did too bad for someone who had never sung before, and I had a lot of fun learning the music and bonding with the other members. That was how I began to love music.
By grade two I had moved back to Canada for good. I continued to sing in the choir at Buttonville Public School. My parents enrolled me in piano lessons (for the high school credit) when I was in grade four, which I hated taking all the way up to grade eight. (Then I realized how useful it was and how much I enjoyed playing. Funnily enough, I still take piano today and have long ago surpassed accreditation requirements.) In grade six I chose the clarinet as my school instrument because I hoped to upgrade to bass clarinet (the way cooler, more badass version) down the line. When my music teacher assigned me to bass clarinet in grade seven, it was a match made in heaven. In the summer between grade seven and eight I saved up enough money to by myself a Les Paul. By the time grade eight came around, I was in instrumental band, jazz band, orchestra, choir, piano class, and guitar class. (Recess really wasn’t a thing for me.) <br><br>
I continued to and continue to play music because it’s become such a big part of who I am. That feeling you get when you’re playing, and everything and everyone just fits together? I can’t get enough of that feeling. And I’ve made a bunch of awesome friends along the way. It expresses feelings in ways that words sometimes cannot, and being able to tap into the meaning and mood behind music has made me more sensitive and emotionally connected in general. Every time I learn a new instrument, it is a fantastic struggle. I hope to learn even more in the years to come. <br>
Playing music contributes to my meaning because being able to move people with music, either emotionally or physically, is a strange and exciting power. It’s something that I love to do and feel like I should be doing. Somewhere along the way I figured out that I want to continue affecting lives (any way, any how) in this manner: giving the gift of music to others, just like my friend did when she grabbed my hand on that crazy day in grade one.

							<h2><span>October 31st, 2010 (2H)</span></h2>
							<div>
								On October 31st, 2010, I listened to Green Day’s American Idiot from front to back. It went through my veins like a drug. It was the most incredible hour of anything I had ever listened to. I became obsessed with the band and their music. There were adolescent feelings that I had at that stage in my life that I had never heard expressed before, let alone put to a tune. Their discography collectively became almost like an anthem. That was my first genuine exposure to politics as well. <br><br>
I could identify with their attitude. When I went to watch them in concert on April 11th, 2013 (still the best day of my life, bar none), they played like it was their last. They are over 40 years old and still kicking. They inspire me not to give up because they never have, not on their music or their fans. They are not afraid of returning to their roots; I remember not to forget who I am. This California punk trio has definitely been one of my biggest influences. <br><br>
There is something else I have to thank them for as well. Virtually the entirety of my knowledge of pop culture stems from getting into Green Day. When I first started listening to them, I watched every interview there was to be found. The band would talk about their musical influences growing up, as well as modern-day peers in the industry. That was how I got into The Who, David Bowie, The Clash, and The Killers, and it just spread from there. 
It was around this time that I got a Tumblr account. When I signed on, I noticed that many of the people who shared my taste in music also seemed to like watching shows like Sherlock and Doctor Who, so I began watching those. In much the same manner, my interests expanded to accommodate more TV shows and movies. I became a Tolkien fan. I became a Rush fan. I became a Freaks and Geeks fan. I became an Arctic Monkeys fan. Having this rather eclectic taste in entertainment has shaped my world view to be wider in general, in addition to being much more liberal. I honestly don’t think I would be nearly as street-smart without this kind of exposure to pop culture.

							<h2><span>September 4th, 2015 (2I)</span></h2>
							<div>
								I started grade nine in the 2012-2013 school year. Going to UHS has had a huge impact on me. I couldn’t enter Bayview’s International Baccalaureate program because of a technicality, and I was set to go to Markville Secondary School for their Gifted program before my parents convinced me to go to UHS instead. And I don’t regret my decision a bit. The past three years have been filled with amazing ups and downs and most importantly, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting some really cool people. There comes a time when you realize that without people, life would be an absolute desert. I’m glad that that has never been the case for me here.
