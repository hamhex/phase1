							<h2><span>Grade 2, October (3A)</span></h2>
							<div><p>It was the end of the day, the bell had rung, and I was the last student to leave the classroom. I had gathered up all of my belongings and was about to leave when I noticed something written on the side of my desk. It didn’t look like any word I’d ever come across before. I asked my teacher about it, and she said she would take care of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“But what does it mean?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t worry about it.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents wouldn’t tell me anything either.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mom, Dad? What does ‘fuck’ mean?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t say that word, Jocelyn.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“But why?”<br>
I couldn’t understand what the big fuss was about. It was a simple four-letter word. I only discovered what it meant much later, and at that point I was just surprised that a single word could be so loaded. In the realization that language could be incredibly powerful, I became captivated by it and began to read a lot (see Exhibit 1J).</p></div>

							<h2><span>Late to the Party (3B)</span></h2>
							<div><p>For the vast majority of my life, I’ve lived contently. I went to school, hung out with my friends, and spent time with my family. I just went with the flow of things. If I messed up at any point, I would say to myself, “Oh, I’ve still got plenty of time before I have to worry about that kind of stuff.” My “plenty of time” came and passed, and it struck me at the end of grade nine that I was going to be applying for university in a few short years. That soon, I was going to be out on my own to find my place in the world. Then I discovered that my post-secondary prospects start being directly affected once grade ten starts, and that the minimum admission requirements for universities are not as low as I think they are, and that it would be a good idea to start thinking about scholarships, and I got the message: you shape up or you ship out. A year ago all of that so-called “grown-up stuff” was lightyears away and then there I was, looking up at a mountain that I never even knew existed, one that I couldn’t possibly climb. I was attacked with a barrage of expectations, commitments, and demands. I’d go home after school and lie on my bed and try to piece together my direction. 
It occurred to me that once I graduate high school, a lot of things that I think are important now, are no longer going to be important. But not everything. There were aspects I wanted to keep, but I had to figure out what they were.
I’m actually glad that this anxiety hit me before grade ten, because it allowed me more time to start figuring out what I wanted. Now that I’m in grade twelve, I feel more secure about where I’m headed.</p></div>

							<h2><span>Picture Perfect (3C)</span></h2>
							<div><p>A number of things happened between grade nine and twelve. My paternal grandmother suffered a stroke and was hospitalized for a long while before she eventually was moved to a nursing home. My grandfather, unable to live by himself in the apartment that they shared, moved out to live with one of his children. For one reason or another, he never stayed anywhere for long. He was with us for a brief period, but it was impractical since we’re all gone during the day. Besides (as I understand it), my mom wasn’t a fan of him staying with us. He eventually joined his wife in the nursing home. My dad’s oldest sister was diagnosed with cancer as well, and has undergone two chemotherapy treatments (as I understand it).<br><br>
All of this created a lot of tension in the family. e.g. Nursing home care is insanely expensive. My paternal grandparents have 5 children. A 5-way split of the monthly bill between the children would make sense, would it not? It turns out that (as I understand it) my dad - our family - pays the largest fraction of the bill. I have never found out why.<br><br>
I’ve also noticed that we’ve all been drifting apart. The family has always had a lunch on Saturday together. When I was little, the number of seats we took up would regularly hit 20. Nowadays, it’s a good week if 10 of us show up. My aunt who got cancer? I haven’t seen her in over 2 years. She doesn’t respond to emails or calls or texts from any of us.<br><br>

This is pretty much the one part of my life that is completely out of my control. And that scared me when I realized that some situations are unsolvable, inevitable. The immediacy/closeness of the incidents shattered my presumption that nothing bad could ever happen to any of us, that we’d stay picture-perfect like that photo hanging in the living room. I also began to really feel the weight on my shoulders since someday I know I will have to do the same. It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when, because these 3 years have made me decide that I will always be indebted and obligated to my family. My hope is to be able to serve them in turn in the years to come.</p></div>

							<h2><span>Um. (3D)</span></h2>
							<div><p>I was rummaging around in my parent’s room one time, looking for something, when I saw a box that I really wish I hadn’t seen. <br><br>
For me, this event put a stake in the ground with regards to my loss of innocence. I was old enough to know what the box was, what its implications were. I was old enough to be deeply disturbed by its presence. And that meant that somewhere along the line, I had stopped being a child. There was no way I could ever go back. I looked at old pictures of me up on the wall. Could I have ever been that pure, that untouched? I will never be like that again. It was like my whole childhood was just dying all around me, and I mourned its loss.</p></div>

							<h2><span>Coming of Age (3E)</span></h2>
							<div><p>On September 13th, 2015, my grandparents flew back to Hong Kong after a month-long stay in Canada. They will not be back for a long while. On September 13th, 2015, I cried alone 4 separate times. <br><br>
It wasn’t because they were flying back home. When I was younger they would come for a visit every year. This time was different. They hadn’t seen me for nearly 3 years, and I had changed a lot in that time. <br><br>
On days when my parents were working, I’d take my grandparents around the city to see the sights, make sure they were on time for the bus, helped them order at restaurants, and generally made them feel at home. <br><br>
When it came time for them to leave, my grandparents took me aside privately. “You know that we love you very much. Every year we came here, we have been able to watch you grow. But this visit has been different. You are not a girl anymore. You’re growing into a woman, and we wished we’d noticed that sooner. We’ve taken care of you all your life, but for the past month, you were the one taking care of us.
“You have to take care of your family now.” And I knew this to be true. That was the first time I noticed my dad’s white hair, the bags under my mom’s eyes.<br><br>
“要生性了” were my grandfather’s words. 生性 directly translates to “develop character”. The entire expression means “It is time to grow up and be more mature now.” Those four words broke my heart. I knew deep down that I was no longer a child, that I hadn’t been one for quite some time. But this solidified it for me. I was an adult now, even in my grandparents’ eyes, with all the responsibilities that that title comes with.<br><br>
I will not turn 18 until fall next year, but in my mind, I am already there.</p></div>

							<h2><span>June 23rd, 2015 - The Shwah (3F)</span></h2>
							<div><p>On June 23rd, 2015, I bussed (no G1) to Oshawa to buy a guitar pedal for a friend. I didn’t bring enough change for one of the bus trips, so I ended up walking 45 minutes to the next bus stop. (Not a fun time.) My parents had no idea. On June 15th, 2015, I went with a friend to a Kooks concert downtown. They didn’t know about that either. I’ve snuck out of the house to go to concerts (or not-concerts) a few times now. It’s almost a compulsion, and it’s not just about the destination either; the journey is important too. I actually really like taking public transit. I love the independence of it, the solitude. There’s a freedom to it, knowing I could keep riding. I could go to Burlington if I wanted to. Or even farther. These experiences have had a sobering effect on me and served to make me a more self-sufficient person. I’ve had some of my most introspective moments while travelling. In fact, many of the ideas presented in these galleries emerged from long public transit rides. The rides have definitely made me more aware of myself.</p></div>

							<h2><span>June 2015 (3G)</span></h2>
							<div><p>I was offered drugs for the first time in June, 2015. But what was important about this moment wasn’t about what was being asked of me; it was the decision itself. It was a significant decision that I was consciously making, and it was mine and mine alone. Had I said yes, no one would have found out; I was doing something for my own sake. I said no, and at the same time, made a promise to myself that my answer would always be no. It was a deeply personal choice I made that day, and its significance empowered me retain the gumption to stick to other decisions that I’ve made.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypkmp6D90KU">Straight Edge</a><br>Minor Threat</p></div>

							<h2><span>To Whom It May Concern ... (3H)</span></h2>
							<div><p>My family is Christian but we have never gone to church. It’s hard to tell that we even are a religious household, unless one sees the little figure of Jesus that hangs on the living room wall. I made my own choice to read children’s bibles when I was little, and I joined a fellowship recently in order to further explore my relationship with God. I think that all of this has contributed to my being an agnostic theist. My belief is that God would like me to find my own meaning and that I have within me the ability to do so, but that He empowers me when the journey gets tough. My relationship with Him anchors me when the way ahead becomes shrouded in fog and bad faith.</p>

							<h2><span>September 19-21, 2014 (3I)</span></h2>
							<div><p>On September 19th, 2014, I went to a 2-night, 3-day hackathon at the University of Waterloo. I didn’t get any sleep at all during that time, but I never noticed because everything was just insane. I was in a group with a tenth-grader from Tennessee and two computer science undergraduates from the university. The tenth-grader knew 20 times more than everyone else in the group. I felt so out of my comfort zone, because everyone seemed put together, but I also felt incredibly inspired. The experience gave me a deeper understanding of what artistry was, something that I’ve been able to apply to my other creative disciplines. Here were people with similar aspirations. Every single one was self-motivated and passionate about what they do, regardless of whether or not it’s “worthy” or “trivial”. Not only that, but all participants were incredibly supportive of each other. The atmosphere was amazing to be a part of. It changed my attitude a lot in terms of how to go about pursuing a goal or passion - to do so first and foremost for yourself, and to not forget why you are doing it.</p></div>

							<h2><span>Ashes to Ashes (3J)</span></h2>
							<div><p>This isn’t any particular event per se, but I was raised to have a pretty practical mindset. As a child, whenever I got upset and started tearing up, my parents would tell me to stop because “crying doesn’t solve anything”. Even though I’m more independent now, that’s always sort of stuck with me - the idea that you should always be making progress, working toward solving the problem in front of you. And anything that gets in the way of that is, for all intents and purposes, an obstacle. 
We were having our weekly family gathering a few months ago (see Exhibit 3C) and all of the adults were openly discussing funeral and burial arrangements for my grandparents. They were and still are alive! Yes, they are beginning to be very old, but they aren’t sick or dying! That conversation really messed around with my head. Here was a matter of no doubt great emotional and financial weight, and they were talking about it over brunch!<br><br>
There was even some humour:<br>
“Do you think we’ll be able to get their tombstones standing next to each other?”<br>
“I don’t think it matters. I mean, we’re the ones who are gonna care about tombstone placement. They won’t be around to care.” *chuckles all around* <br><br>

So my perspective on things has always been from that kind of side. I have had many people tell me that they come to me for help because they see me as a really down-to-earth person. I think it’s made me more clear-minded than anything else with regards to decision-making, and not getting side-tracked when trying to find my meaning.</p></div>
