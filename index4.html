							<h2><span>????????????????? (4A)</span></h2>
							<div><p>When I was little, I had a friend who wanted to become the Prime Minister. At the time I thought, “Wow! Wouldn’t it be great to have such a big effect on so many people?” Over the years I’ve realized that one doesn’t have to become Prime Minister in order to do this. I’ve seen the way art - in any form - can move people to tears, to laughter. I’ve seen the smallest inventions - objects as small as body electrodes - transform millions of lives worldwide. I’ve seen how much it means to people when I give them homemade gifts, or stay up really really late talking to them. An overwhelming portion of my meaning stems from this - making a positive difference in people’s lives. Something I’ve kept going back to is this Dickinson poem:<br><br>
If I can stop one heart from breaking,<br>
I shall not live in vain; <br>
If I can ease one life the aching, <br>
Or cool one pain, <br>
Or help one fainting robin<br> 
Unto his nest again, <br>
I shall not live in vain. </p></div>

							<h2><span>You is kind. You is smart. You is important. (4B)</span></h2>
							<div><p>If I had to sum up my meaning in one word, it would be helping others. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I think I suffer from a lack of self-interest. I've avoided completing my homework in order to help others finish theirs. I've stayed up with people until 4 a.m. because they needed someone to talk to. It is honestly so much easier to do something for someone else rather than myself.<br><br>It's actually a weird thing because I like people, but I generally don't like dealing with them directly (see Exhibits 2A-2D) so I think going forward, I'm looking for opportunities for indirect service to others. </p></div>

							<h2><span>The 'Rents (4C)</span></h2>
							<div><p>My relationship with my parents is kind of weird in the sense that I love them and am basically indebted to them forever, but at the same time I want to get as far away from them as possible after graduation.<br><br>
I’ve said before that they are highly critical people (2C), and there was a point when nothing I did seemed good enough for them, which only exacerbated the perfectionist in me. Their critical worldviews also instilled pessimism and cynicism in me. They constantly talk about the ways in which the world is flawed, how it will never be a perfect place because of people. I’m not sure what they were going for; maybe they wanted me to feel a sense of responsibility for changing society. Or maybe they just wanted to let me know that the world is a dark, scary place (which is true in more ways than one). Every time I go out i.e. any time I am not physically at home or school, they treat Markham like it’s crawling with rapists, ex-convicts, and axe murderers, and tell me to take every precaution. In one way they’re being overprotective; I’m statistically unlikely to run into any one of those kinds of people at any given time of day. In the other way, I’m sure it’s saved me more than once. Regardless, I feel a sense of slight distrust now towards most strangers when I am outside school.<br><br>
My parents are generally pretty conservative, so there are some things that I can’t agree with them on, and it bugs me to know that we may never see eye-to-eye on certain things. I don’t mean little things, like their constant bugging me to clean my room (and my refusal to do so). I’ve never mentioned taking a year off after grade 12, because I don’t think “taking a year off” is even in their vocabulary. I’ve never asked if they would disown me if I came out as a lesbian, because I am scared of what the answer will be. I’ve never asked them for their opinion on me being in an interracial romantic relationship, because my family is probably pureblood Chinese (side note: the person I mentioned in Exhibit 2F is of African descent). Well, would you look at that. It’s me shutting up again! (see Exhibit 2A)

							<h2><span>True North (4D)</span></h2>
							<div><p>I definitely feel a pull towards my society for sure. As much as Canada has its flaws, I felt proud to represent during ICDC (see Exhibit 2E) and whenever I travel to the States. I cheer for the nation’s athletes during sports events (despite my lack of knowledge about anything sports related), and I’m excited to vote when I come of age. But I think it goes deeper than patriotism. I feel a sense of responsibility for the country. As much as it’s my dream to live in the Bay Area, I don’t think I could live anywhere else permanently. It’s one of the reasons I’m choosing to stay in Ontario for university. <br><br> I’m also definitely tied to this community. If only all kids were lucky enough to be raised in such a safe, diverse, and welcoming environment (and excitement is only a half-hour’s drive south). It’s why I try to volunteer and be environmentally friendly whenever I can, in the hopes that this place continues to be awesome for other people.
