							<div><p>When I was little, I had a friend who wanted to become the Prime Minister. At the time I thought, “Wow! Wouldn’t it be great to have such a big effect on so many people?” Over the years I’ve realized that one doesn’t have to become Prime Minister in order to do this. I’ve seen the way art - in any form - can move people to tears, to laughter. I’ve seen the smallest inventions - objects as small as body electrodes - transform millions of lives worldwide. I’ve seen how much it means to people when I give them homemade gifts, or stay up really really late talking to them. An overwhelming portion of my meaning stems from this - making a positive difference in people’s lives. Something I’ve kept going back to is this Dickinson poem:<br><br>
If I can stop one heart from breaking,<br>
I shall not live in vain; <br>
If I can ease one life the aching, <br>
Or cool one pain, <br>
Or help one fainting robin<br> 
Unto his nest again, <br>
I shall not live in vain. </p></div>

							<h2><span>You is kind. You is smart. You is important. (4A)</span></h2>
							<div><p>If I had to sum up my meaning in one word, it would be helping others. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I think I suffer from a lack of self-interest. I've avoided completing my homework in order to help others finish theirs. I've stayed up with people until 4 a.m. because they needed someone to talk to. It is honestly so much easier to do something for someone else rather than myself.<br><br>It's actually a weird thing because I like people, but I generally don't like dealing with them directly (see Gallery 2A-2D) so I think going forward, I'm looking for opportunities for indirect service to others. </p></div>
